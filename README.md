# Restaurant - Ravintola

A web application intended mainly for table reservations. Reservation is done through API operations (frontend logic).
The user, thanks to the React-router-dom library, dynamically changes the content of the page. 
The application also gets all the data from the API about the menu card and displays it.

Possibility to edit the menu as an administrator, and access (possibility to edit) to all reservations.

on current reservations downloaded from the API). At the moment of checking the free tables for a
given hour, all existing free hours are returned ---> the user selects the hour.

(or click outside the modal area) and highlighted css styles for the selected date.<br>

#### - Filter Dishes

The admin can filter the dishes by category, recommendation status, text phrase.
The loading of dishes is done via API, the redux states (3 stages of data downloading -> change of the "loading" state) allow for lazy loading.
Filters and fetched dishes from the API go to the global state of the application, which is stored by redux.
Each item on the list has access to delete, quick edit the recommendation status and view detailed information.
On the left side, check boxes are used to perform multitasking operations (delete, change status).

#### - Details of the dish

View all information about a specific dish. Possibility to edit any information.
Possibility to remove the dish. Button to go back to the previous list of dishes (if it was filtered, the filters will still be applied)

#### - Adding dishes

The form is validated, all (*) fields are required and must match the patterns given.
Uploading a photo causes the photo to be replaced in the second part of the form.
After correct completion of the form, a message appears.
